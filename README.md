# RoomBa Discord Bot

A discord bot for restricting access to single-person private channels such that people need to request entry and can be kicked by the owner.

## Instructions

### Admin
If you have admin permissions on the discord server you may run these commands.

#### Creating Rooms

    /admin create [discord channel] [room name] [discord user owner]

- `[discord channel]` is the discord channel on the discord server this room is associated with. 
- `[room name]` is the name you wish to give the room, that people can lookup.
- `[discord user owner]` the discord user you want to assign as the owner of this room.

#### Deleting Rooms

    /admin delete [discord channel]

- `[discord channel]` is the discord channel you want rooms removed from.


#### Changing Ownership

    /admin change_owner [discord channel] [new discord user]

- `[discord channel]` is the discord channel you are reassigning ownership.
- `[new discord user]` is the new discord user you want to assign as owner.

This command will disable ownership of the previous owner automatically but they will remain in the room unless they have left previously.
